## Sample Q&A on Your Data

This guide outlines the steps to create a Q&A system that answers questions based on your provided data using a combination of Gemini and potentially Cohere (depending on your embedding strategy).

**Prerequisites:**

*   A Google AI Studio API Key.  Obtain one at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/new_chat).
*   A Cohere API Key. If you intend to use Cohere for embeddings, create an account and get your API key.

**Setup Instructions:**

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    Activate the virtual environment using the appropriate command for your operating system:

    *   **Windows:**

        ```bash
        venv/Scripts/Activate
        ```

    *   **Linux/macOS:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Install the necessary Python packages using `pip`.  Ensure your virtual environment is active:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Create a `requirements.txt` file listing dependencies such as `google-generativeai`, `cohere`, `python-dotenv`, `langchain`, `faiss-cpu` or other relevant packages.)*

4.  **Configure API Keys:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.  Provide your API keys using the following format:

    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    COHERE_API_KEY="YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY_HERE"  # Only if using Cohere embeddings
    ```

    Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_COHERE_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API keys.  If you're not using Cohere, you don't need to include the `COHERE_API_KEY` line.

5.  **Customize System Prompt (Gemini):**

    Adjust the system prompt for the Gemini model to optimize its performance for question answering. This prompt should guide Gemini to answer questions accurately and concisely based on the retrieved context.

6.  **Vector Store (Important - In-Memory vs. Persistent):**

    *   **Note:** The example likely uses an *in-memory* vector store. This is suitable for testing but *not* for production.

    *   **For Production:** For production deployments, use a *persistent* vector database. Options include:

        *   **ChromaDB:** (Open-source, embeddable)
        *   **Pinecone:** (Cloud-based, scalable)
        *   **Weaviate:** (Cloud-native, GraphQL interface)
        *   **FAISS:** (Simple, efficient, but requires more manual setup)

    *   **Implementation:** Migrating to a persistent vector store involves:

        *   Installing the vector store's Python package.
        *   Configuring a connection to your chosen vector database.
        *   Modifying your code to store and query embeddings from the database, instead of RAM.

**You're Done!**

You have successfully created a Q&A system using Gemini. Customize the system prompt, explore persistent vector store options, and refine your data processing for improved accuracy and scalability.

**Happy learning!**

**Key Terminology:**

*   **Q&A System:** A system designed to answer questions based on a knowledge base.
*   **Virtual Environment:** An isolated Python environment for managing project dependencies.
*   **API Key:** A secret key used to authenticate your application with external services (Gemini, Cohere).
*   **System Prompt:** Instructions given to the language model (Gemini) to influence its behavior.
*   **Vector Store:** A database optimized for storing and querying vector embeddings.
*   **In-Memory Vector Store:** A vector store that stores data in RAM, losing data on application shutdown.
*   **Persistent Vector Store:** A vector store that stores data on disk or in the cloud, preserving data across application restarts.
*   **Embeddings:** Numerical representations of text, capturing semantic meaning for efficient similarity searches.
*   **Cohere:** A company that provides language AI models and tools, including embedding models.
